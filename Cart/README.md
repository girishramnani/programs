# Cart ( Code animated reader and tutor )
Code animated reader and tutor ,created in python is a code reader which leverages the power of github's commit feature to animate the process of code writing.It also works as a tutor making each commit a level to reach and at 100 % you get a complete clone of the given repo. In tutor mode you can see the next step and then understand as well as write the code.
This will help new programmers to learn how to develop large applications and also think in such a pragmatic way.
This program , i m more thinking as of a desktop application but would also try to make a web app.


##  #1 Iteration of the project


Created a textEdit which will the main viewing area of the editor. It now has a popup menu for spell check but the data model is file based so would be changing that to RD using sqlalchemy(most prob).



###To-do

<ul>
<li> Develop a notepad++ like UI with spell check </li>
<li> integreting version control inside the editor </li>
<li> syntax highlighting </li>
<li> tree structure (like in sublime text when dragged a directory on the window), to show the current file being typed </li> 
<li> speed adjust </li>
<li> controls like stop , play , type your self etc </li>
<li> A training mode to actually let the person type the code in and check for errors making each commit a milestone for the programmer to reach, like typing tutor but here typing code. </li>
</ul>


## Language prefered : python or java
